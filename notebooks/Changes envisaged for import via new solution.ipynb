    "Tracing back to history Emisoft platform is based on a solution which is modelled according to an industry domain wherein the solution depicts the entities and the relationships as pervalent in the domain and this is primarily modelled by the configurators using the solution designer. When it comes to designing the runtime for the end users based on this solution during the software development stages effectively it tended to fit the domain driven design philosphy whereby if the domain entities with their respective behavior and validations self contained  could be generated based on how the solution configurators defined it then it should be very easy to design the application in true DDD philosphy. \n",
    "In the existing design the DDD tenet is partially done due to the true types of the entities not being run at dynamic and over the yers much thought has been gone to how to utilize the true types of the entities by dint of which the application could be made much simpler and also performance efficient. Also it needs to be borne in mind that during the initial conception stage the idea was way ahead of the technology but now new technology trends are emerging in the Microsoft space itself with .Net Core whereby doamin entiy types as in the true sense modelled by the configurators acn be utilized as is by the platform runtime.\n",
    "Hereby we are presented a chnace to capitalize on the technology trend and move on to the .Net Core platform to lay the foundation for future complete migration by the overhaul required of impot functionality.\n",
    "Note of caution: While moving to .Net Core the tendency would be to move everything related to .Net Core, this is is really unnecessary as it is worth remembering that Microsoft is slated to release .Net 5 in November 2020 which is a unified framework combing both he the .Net framework and the .Net Core worlds.

For transfer over the wire from UI to the web server whether DTO needs to be modelled on this domain entity is a personal choice and DTOs can be generated if deemed necessary. But since now over web api we use json to map an entity so we donot necessarily need DTO.

    "(i) The primary goal is to have a cleaner separation across the layers in terms of code so the functionalities are not scattered across the layers. <br/>(ii) As much as possible across all the sectrum of development try to reflect what the configurators intended to model by giving special attention to the domain entities and using them rather than a generic entity structure which can result in gap in usage in terms of configurators and devlopers.<br/> (iii) For the data layer in the runtime solution right now the queries as fired for the CUD operations are written by hand and are more likely to be error prone and also ineffciennt as also with respect to handling of transactions. By going for a tried and test EF Core to handle the CUD operations will at least ensure efficient, well tested queries as well also the entity along with its child entities can be in one go.<br/> \n",
    "(iv) Implementing .Net Core gives a little ease of convenience in terms of development at least in terms of injecvting classes and utilizing them, and by its lightweightedness it is guaranteed to be a bit more performance efficient than .net Framework. But as noted with the slated rel;ease of .Net 5 in the near future this distinction between .net core and .net Framework is going to be blurred.   <br/>      \n"
