Chnage is sought primarily with respect to the \"C-Command\" of the CQRS with respect to Add/Update/Delete operations to primarily enable a cleaner seaparation of the logic across different application layers/tiers. The \"Q-Query\" of the CQRS is best left to retain the existing logic of receiveing data from the BAService or SOADataGridService till the time the frontend application is not ready to be changed."

    "Tracing back to history Emisoft platform is based on a solution which is modelled according to an industry domain wherein the solution depicts the entities and the relationships as pervalent in the domain and this is primarily modelled by the configurators using the solution designer. When it comes to designing the runtime for the end users based on this solution during the software development stages effectively it tended to fit the domain driven design philosphy whereby if the domain entities with their respective behavior and validations self contained  could be generated based on how the solution configurators defined it then it should be very easy to design the application in true DDD philosphy. \n",
    "In the existing design the DDD tenet is partially done due to the true types of the entities not being run at dynamic and over the yers much thought has been gone to how to utilize the true types of the entities by dint of which the application could be made much simpler and also performance efficient. Also it needs to be borne in mind that during the initial conception stage the idea was way ahead of the technology but now new technology trends are emerging in the Microsoft space itself with .Net Core whereby doamin entiy types as in the true sense modelled by the configurators acn be utilized as is by the platform runtime.\n",
    "Hereby we are presented a chnace to capitalize on the technology trend and move on to the .Net Core platform to lay the foundation for future complete migration by the overhaul required of impot functionality."

As we see withut much chnage it can be made comaptible to .Net standard and made use of in .Net Core as is. For transfer over the wire from UI to the web server whether DTO needs to be modelled on this domain entity is a personal choice and DTOs can be generated if deemed necessary. But since now over web api we use json to map an entity so we donot necessarily need DTO. AS we are not modifying the query operations so all the lquery logic as existiung written in the methods of this entities can be left as is."
